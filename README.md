# email-scheduling-assistant

This is going to be an open-sourced email scheduling assistant. 

Essentially, it'll interface between GPT, your calendar, and an email inbox. 

Then you cc the assistant and ask it to find a time for you and someone else to meet, in a thread. 

It suggests times that you're available, and handles the responses that all meeting participants make in the email thread to find a time. 

Then it sends a calendar invite out, and its work is done. 

It needs to read from your calendar, but you'll still manually approve the invites it sends, so that you never get surprised (which is my preference, you're welcome to fork & alter that behavior).

Many people use Calendly-type solutions. 

I personally find these to involve too much upfront effort, while the low-friction 'booking' interface creates issues of its own. 

I hate one-sided re-scheduling, and would prefer a polite but firm AI butler to stand in between me and people altering meeting times without a double opt-in. 

The idea of an email-only scheduling assistant is far from novel, indeed there are examples dating back to the early 2010s. The only difference is that this is a lightweight open-source assistant. I might make a nice wrapper for it and charge for access to that, but the source code will always be free.
