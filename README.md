# email-scheduling-assistant

This is going to be an open-sourced email scheduling assistant. Essentially, it'll be a wrapper around GPT, your calendar, and an email inbox. Then you cc the assistant and ask it to find a time for you and someone else to meet, in a thread. It suggests times that you're available, and handles the responses that all meeting participants make in the email thread to find a time. Then it sends a calendar invite out, and its work is done.

Obvs many people use Calendly-type solutions. I personally find these to involve too much upfront effort, while the low-friction 'booking' interface creates issues of its own (last minute re-schedules, people booking in times you forgot to block off, etc). 

The idea of an email-only scheduling assistant is far from novel, indeed there are examples dating back to the early 2010s. The only difference here is this is a lightweight open-source assistant. I might make a nice wrapper for it and charge for access to that, but the source code will always be free.
